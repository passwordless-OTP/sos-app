## üìù Key Insights

- **AI Priority**: Text-based Q&A is the CORE feature, not voice
- **Voice Strategy**: Simple voice-to-text only, no voice responses in MVP
- **Focus**: Perfect the AI's ability to answer store questions before adding voice
- **Network Effect**: Fraud detection network is the unique differentiator
