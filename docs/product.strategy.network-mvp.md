# SOS Store Manager - Network-Effect MVP Strategy

## New Vision: "Waze for Shopify Merchants"
**Merchants share security signals → Everyone gets smarter protection → Network grows stronger**

## Fundamental Pivot

### From: Individual Store Assistant
### To: Collective Security Intelligence Network

Every merchant contributes anonymized data:

- Failed payment patterns
- Unusual traffic spikes

Every merchant benefits from the network:
- Real-time risk scores
- Preemptive blocking
- Fraud prevention
- Community alerts

- Features behind paywalls

### Phase 3: Network Effects (Month 2+)
- Geographic clusters start forming
- Industry-specific intelligence emerges

## Competitive Advantages

1. **First-Mover in Network Model**: No one else doing collective intelligence
2. **Zero-Cost Entry**: Removes all friction vs. $299/month competitors

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|

4. **Partner with 10 beta merchants who've experienced fraud**

**The AI assistant features become the friendly interface to a powerful security network, not the main product.**
