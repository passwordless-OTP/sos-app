## Quick Start: Minimum Viable Documentation (MVP)
For the fastest possible launch, create these documents first:
1. Product Requirements Document (PRD)
2. Technical Architecture Document
3. UI/UX Design Specifications
4. API Integration Specifications
5. Deployment Checklist
6. User Documentation (basic version)
7. Privacy Policy & Terms of Service

This represents approximately 80-100 pages of documentation that can be created incrementally as you build.
