# Industry Standard KPIs vs. SOS Innovation

## 📊 Industry Standard Security/E-commerce KPIs

### What Everyone Measures Today

#### Security Metrics
- **False Positive Rate (FPR)** - Good transactions blocked
- **True Positive Rate (TPR)** - Bad transactions caught  
- **Precision/Recall** - ML model accuracy
- **Block Rate** - % of traffic blocked
- **Response Time** - Milliseconds to decision

#### E-commerce Metrics  
- **Conversion Rate (CR)** - Orders/Visitors
- **Cart Abandonment Rate** - Lost checkouts
- **Average Order Value (AOV)** - $/Order
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV/LTV)** - Total customer value
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** - Cost per customer

#### Fraud Metrics
- **Fraud Rate** - Fraudulent orders/Total orders
- **Chargeback Rate** - Disputed transactions
- **Manual Review Rate** - Orders needing human review
- **Approval Rate** - Orders approved/Total orders

## 🚀 SOS Proprietary KPIs (Our Innovation)

### Why We Created New Ones

**Problem with Standard KPIs**:
- They measure security OR conversion, not both
- They treat friction as universally bad
- They don't capture network effects
- They're binary (block/allow) not adaptive

### Our KPI Innovations

| SOS KPI | What It's Based On | Why It's New |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| **FER** | False Positive Rate + Speed | Adds time penalty & good actor experience |
| **CLF** | Conversion Rate | Measures lift from INTELLIGENT friction |
| **GAES** | User Experience metrics | Security-specific UX score |
| **BAFC** | Cost per attack (new concept) | Makes fraud economically unviable |
| **NBS** | Network effect value (new) | Quantifies shared verification value |

## 📈 Mapping to Industry Standards

### How to Translate for Investors/Industry

```yaml
When they ask for:    Show them:           Plus our:
─────────────────    ────────────         ─────────
False Positive Rate → Still track it   +  FER (adds experience)
Conversion Rate     → Still track it   +  CLF (shows improvement)  
Fraud Rate          → Still track it   +  TDR (real-time)
Cart Abandonment    → Still track it   +  GAES (good actors only)
ROI                 → Still track it   +  NBS (network value)
```

## 🎯 Industry Adoption Potential

### These Could Become Standards Because:

1. **Gartner/Forrester Gap** - No current metrics for "adaptive security"
2. **Market Need** - Everyone struggles with security vs. conversion
3. **Network Effects** - No metrics exist for shared security value
4. **AI/ML Evolution** - Need metrics for intelligent systems

### Similar Innovation Examples
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** - Invented by Bain & Company
- **Customer Effort Score (CES)** - Created by CEB
- **Core Web Vitals** - Google's new UX metrics
- **DORA Metrics** - DevOps performance indicators

## 📋 Practical Implementation

### Phase 1: Dual Reporting
Report both standard AND SOS metrics:
```
Standard: "False Positive Rate: 2.1%"
SOS Add:  "Friction Efficiency Rate: 94%"

Standard: "Conversion Rate: 3.2%"  
SOS Add:  "Conversion Lift from Friction: +12%"
```

### Phase 2: Education
- White papers on new metrics
- Case studies showing correlation
- Industry conference talks
- Open-source calculation methods

### Phase 3: Industry Adoption
- Partner with analytics platforms
- Contribute to security standards bodies
- Publish in journals
- Create certification program

## 💡 Positioning Strategy

### For Different Audiences

#### For Investors
"We track all standard KPIs plus proprietary metrics that capture our unique value proposition"

#### For Customers  
"Simple metrics that show you're making more money while staying secure"

#### For Industry
"Next-generation KPIs for the AI-powered security era"

#### For Team
"Our North Star metrics that guide product decisions"

## 🏆 The Opportunity

By creating these KPIs, SOS can:
1. **Define the category** - "Adaptive Security" metrics
2. **Lead the conversation** - Speaking engagements
3. **Build moat** - Others adopt our framework
4. **Attract talent** - Innovative thinking

## 📊 Recommended Approach

### Do Track Industry Standards
- Keep them for benchmarking
- Report them to investors
- Use for competitive analysis

### Do Innovate with SOS KPIs
- Make them our North Stars
- Build product around them
- Educate market on them
- Patent calculation methods?

### Don't
- Ignore industry standards
- Make it too complex
- Hide behind proprietary metrics
- Forget to validate with data
