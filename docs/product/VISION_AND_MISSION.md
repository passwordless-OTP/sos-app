# SOS Product Vision & Mission

## üåü Vision Statement

**To create a world where every Shopify merchant is protected by a collective intelligence network that makes fraud as visible and avoidable as traffic jams.**

We envision SOS as the "Waze for E-commerce Security" - where the entire merchant community benefits from shared threat intelligence, making online fraud increasingly difficult and expensive for bad actors to execute.

## üéØ Mission Statement
