## Executive Summary

This document outlines how SOS transforms e-commerce security through intelligent friction management, resulting in improved conversion rates while maintaining robust security.

## Key Performance Indicators

### Industry Standard Metrics

#### Conversion Rate (CR)

- **Definition**: Percentage of visitors who complete a purchase
- **Industry Average**: 2.86% globally for e-commerce[¹](#ref1)
- **Mobile**: 2.25% average conversion rate[²](#ref2)
- **Desktop**: 3.68% average conversion rate[²](#ref2)

#### Cart Abandonment Rate

- **Global Average**: 69.99% of carts are abandoned[³](#ref3)
- **Primary Reasons**:
  - Extra costs (48%)
  - Account creation required (24%)
  - Complicated checkout (17%)
  - Security concerns (18%)[³](#ref3)

#### Page Load Impact

According to Google Research[⁴](#ref4):

- **0-1 second**: Baseline conversion rate
- **1-3 seconds**: 32% bounce rate increase
- **1-5 seconds**: 90% bounce rate increase
- **1-6 seconds**: 106% bounce rate increase
- **1-10 seconds**: 123% bounce rate increase

Amazon found that every 100ms of latency costs them 1% in sales[⁵](#ref5).

### SOS Proprietary Metrics

#### Friction Efficiency Rate (FER)

**Definition**: Accuracy of applying appropriate security measures to different visitor types

```
FER = (Correct Security Decisions / Total Visitors) × Speed Factor
```

**Target**: >95%
**Benchmark**: Traditional security systems achieve ~70-80% accuracy[⁶](#ref6)

#### Conversion Lift from Friction (CLF)

**Definition**: Revenue increase from intelligent friction application

```
CLF = (Revenue with Intelligent Friction - Baseline Revenue) / Baseline Revenue
```

**Target**: +10-15%
**Industry Context**: Reducing checkout time by 1 second can increase conversions by 7%[⁷](#ref7)

#### Good Actor Experience Score (GAES)

**Definition**: Quality of experience for legitimate customers

```
GAES = (Seamless Checkouts / Legitimate Visitors) × (1 - Average Delay)
```

**Target**: >98%
**Benchmark**: 53% of users abandon sites that take >3 seconds to load[⁸](#ref8)

## Traditional vs. Intelligent Friction

### Traditional Security Approach

#### The One-Size-Fits-All Problem

raditional e-commerce security applies uniform friction to all visitors:

```
All Visitors (100%)
        │
        ▼
Same Security Checks (100%)
        │
        ▼
Conversion Rate: 2.86% (Industry Average)[¹](#ref1)
Lost Sales: 97.14% of visitors
```

**Cost of Traditional Security**:

- False positive rates: 2.5-5% of legitimate transactions blocked[⁹](#ref9)
- Each false positive costs merchants $118 on average[¹⁰](#ref10)
- Global false decline losses: $443 billion annually[¹⁰](#ref10)

### SOS Intelligent Friction Approach

#### Risk-Based Segmentation

Based on fraud prevention industry research[¹¹](#ref11):

```
Visitor Distribution:
├── Low Risk (20%): Previous customers, verified accounts
├── Medium Risk (70%): New visitors, standard behavior
└── High Risk (10%): Suspicious patterns, bot indicators
```

#### Performance by Segment

| Segment              | Traditional CR | SOS CR     | Speed Impact    | Source        |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Low Risk             | 2.86%          | 8-12%\*    | -50% faster     | Internal data |
| Medium Risk          | 2.86%          | 3-4%\*     | ±10%            | Internal data |
| High Risk            | 2.86%          | 0.1%\*     | +500% slower    | Internal data |
| **Weighted Average** | **2.86%**      | **4.2%\*** | **-27% faster** | Calculated    |

\*Based on pilot program results
\*\*47% improvement over baseline

## Performance Impact Analysis

### Site Speed and Revenue Correlation

According to published research:

1. **Walmart**: Every 1 second improvement = 2% conversion increase[¹²](#ref12)
2. **Amazon**: 100ms slower = 1% revenue decrease[⁵](#ref5)
3. **Google**: 500ms delay = 20% traffic drop[¹³](#ref13)
4. **Akamai Study**: 100ms delay = 7% conversion loss[⁷](#ref7)

### Core Web Vitals Impact

Google's research on Core Web Vitals[¹⁴](#ref14):

- **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint): Should be <2.5s
- **FID** (First Input Delay): Should be <100ms
- **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift): Should be <0.1

Sites meeting all three thresholds see:

- 24% less abandonment
- 22% better ad performance
- 15% better organic rankings[¹⁴](#ref14)

### SOS Performance Architecture

#### Edge Computing Benefits

- **Latency Reduction**: 50-80% faster than origin servers[¹⁵](#ref15)
- **Global Coverage**: <50ms response time worldwide[¹⁵](#ref15)
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime SLA[¹⁶](#ref16)

#### Caching Strategy Impact

- **Cache Hit Ratio**: 85-95% for static content[¹⁷](#ref17)
- **Response Time**: <10ms for cached decisions[¹⁷](#ref17)
- **Cost Reduction**: 60-80% lower infrastructure costs[¹⁸](#ref18)

- Mobile conversion rates are 69% lower than desktop[²](#ref2)
- Optimize for mobile performance first

### 2. Progressive Enhancement

- Load critical path first
- Apply security checks asynchronously
- Never block the main thread

### 3. Continuous Monitoring

- Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- Synthetic monitoring
- A/B testing framework
- Weekly optimization cycles
