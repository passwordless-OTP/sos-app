# SOS VC Demo Script (3 minutes)

## Opening (30 seconds)
"Welcome! I'm excited to show you SOS - Store Operations Shield. We're building the 'Waze for Shopify Security' - a community-driven fraud prevention network that also serves as an AI assistant for store owners."

## Problem Statement (30 seconds)
"Every year, e-commerce loses $48 billion to fraud. Small Shopify merchants can't afford enterprise solutions like Signifyd at $1500/month. They need affordable, instant protection. That's where SOS comes in."

## Live Demo (90 seconds)

### 1. Dashboard Overview (20 seconds)
"Here's our dashboard. Notice the clean Shopify-native design. Merchants see their key metrics instantly - today's sales, orders, and our unique Network Risk Level."

### 2. AI Assistant Demo (40 seconds)
"Our killer feature is the AI assistant. Watch this:"
- Type: "What were my sales yesterday?"
- Click "Ask AI"
- Show response: "Your sales yesterday were $3,245 with 12 orders. This is 15% higher than your daily average."

"Merchants can ask anything - inventory, customers, trends. No more digging through reports."

### 3. Fraud Detection Demo (30 seconds)
"Now for fraud protection. See these recent checks? We aggregate data from 10+ APIs and our community network."
- Point to the fraud check table
- "Green means safe, yellow needs review. Each check costs just 5 cents, compared to $1.50 from competitors."
- "The magic? When one merchant flags fraud, the entire network is protected instantly."

## Business Model (30 seconds)
"We monetize through usage-based pricing:
- Free tier: 1,000 checks/month
- Then $0.05 per check
- At scale, this is a $100M+ market opportunity
- Network effects create a moat - more users = better protection"

## Closing/Ask (30 seconds)
"We have 50 beta merchants ready to onboard. With your $500K seed investment, we'll:
1. Complete the fraud API integrations
2. Launch the network 
3. Scale to 1,000 merchants in 6 months

We're not just building a fraud tool - we're creating the intelligence layer for Shopify. Questions?"
