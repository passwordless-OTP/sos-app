# Verifying API Access in Shopify Context

## Current Status

1. **API Key Authentication Issue**: 
   - Created API key: `gsk-8MTehZgJkzrhgQ3Pg4fbTUjqZPeFFgxw`
   - Assigned Role A or B in UI but key gets "unauthenticated" role
   - This appears to be a platform issue with role assignment

2. **Working Solution**: 
   - The app works correctly when accessed through Shopify OAuth
   - Session-based authentication provides proper permissions
   - The `getTodaysSales` action is implemented and ready

## How to Test

1. **Access through Shopify**:
   ```bash
   # Start the dev server
   cd apps/sosv02
   ggt dev
   ```

2. **Install on test store**:
   - Use the installation URL from `ggt dev` output
   - Install on your test Shopify store
   - This provides proper session authentication

3. **Test the AI Assistant**:
   - Click on "What were my sales today?" 
   - The app will fetch real data using the session token
   - Check browser console for logs

## API Implementation

The `getTodaysSales` action at `/apps/sosv02/api/actions/getTodaysSales.ts`:
- Fetches real Shopify order data
- Calculates today's sales metrics
- Returns formatted response with:
  - Total sales amount
  - Order count
  - Top products
  - Currency information

## Next Steps

Since API key authentication has platform limitations, the recommended approach is:
1. Use session-based auth for Shopify embedded app
2. API keys would need platform fix for role assignment
3. For external API access, consider OAuth flow instead
